# SparkWorkout_old
A simple app to help me track my workouts.

UPDATE: This project is being abandoned. I initally started this project learn the basics of Ruby alongside MongoDB.
I learned a lot, but before I continue, I'd rather devote more time to learning my primary language, Java. So I am
porting this project over to Java and will also use MySQL instead of MongoDB since I shouldn't be trying to use
MongoDB as a relational database programmatically when I can just use an actual relational database instead. The new
project will be called SparkFitness (I know, so original).
